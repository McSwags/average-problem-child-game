<h1>zip version</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The damned sprites folder got too big to import so here we are</li>
  <li>Added goofy dialogue system ('E' key)</li>
  <li>Go up to sign and press E (easiest solution for dialogue i could come up with)</li>
  <li>To make more dialogue, duplicate sign and add to the monstrous if statement within objJard and the 'E Key pressed' event, due to limits of the system I can only write one line at a time so this is an idea for a workaround. </li>
</ul>
<h2>CODY! We need these sprites (please and thank you :)</h2>
